## **About**  
**ArtiGAN** (*Artificial Intelligence for Heritage Conservation using GANs*) is an advanced deep learning framework that reconstructs and restores historical artifacts, ancient monuments, and cultural heritage sites using **3D-Aware Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**.  

By harnessing **neural rendering, feature synthesis, and adversarial training**, ArtiGAN creates **photorealistic** and **structurally accurate** restorations from fragmented ruins, incomplete imagery, or missing architectural elements.  

## ðŸ”¥ **Key Features**  
- **3D-Aware GAN Architecture** â€“ Generates high-fidelity restorations using spatial and geometric awareness.  
- **Neural Rendering** â€“ Synthesizes missing textures, structures, and fine details.  
- **Historical Image Completion** â€“ Fills in missing portions of damaged historical images.  
- **Artifact & Monument Reconstruction** â€“ Predicts lost architectural elements using learned priors from existing datasets.  
- **Dataset Agnostic** â€“ Works with archaeological site scans, museum archives, and historical images.  

## ðŸ›  **Installation**  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacktherizzler/ArtiGAN.git
cd ArtiGAN
pip install -r requirements.txt
